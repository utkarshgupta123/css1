    <p>What is CSS?</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
        <li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="qw">CSS is not neccesary</span> <span class="qwe"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once </li><br>
        <li> <span class="bn">External stylesheets are stored in css only</span> </li><br>
    </ol>

    <h2 style="font-style: italic;">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: </h2>

    <div class="zx">
    <ul>
<li> Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
<li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section </li>
<li>External by using a link element to link to an external C SS file. </li>
<li>The most common way to add C SS, is to keep the styles in external C SS files. However,<span class="qwe">in this 
    tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier 
    for you to try it yourself. </li>
    </ul>
</div>


    <p>when comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the
        other hand,applies a style to one unique element,ID is also special in that you csn use a special URL to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has
        been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
